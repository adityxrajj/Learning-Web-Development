# Web Development Projects

Welcome to my repository! I am currently learning web development and posting my source code daily. Each folder or file in this repository represents a different project, small or large, that I work on as I improve my skills.

## 🚀 About This Repository

This repository contains various web development projects, ranging from basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to more advanced concepts like front-end frameworks and back-end development.

I post daily to document my progress and to build a portfolio of projects as I learn new technologies.

## 📂 Folder Structure

Each day, I'll commit a new project with the following structure:

```
/Lecture_01
    index.html
    style.css
    script.js
/Lecture_02
    index.html
    style.css
    script.js
```
Every day will contain:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file
- `style.css`: The CSS file for styling
- `script.js`: JavaScript code (if applicable)

## 💻 Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- (Other technologies as I learn them)

## 🚧 Work in Progress

This is an ongoing learning project. As I progress, I'll be adding new features, frameworks, and tools to expand my web development knowledge.
